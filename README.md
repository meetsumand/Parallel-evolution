# Parallel-evolution
This folder contains codes used to generate umerical data in the paper "Unpredictable repeatability in molecular evolution". 
The codes are in FORTRAN and can be compiled with the gfortran compiler. 
The code pkdist2.f90 generates the distribution of P_2 (as decribed in the paper). Parameters can be tuned to alter the distribution. 
The code pkvk.f90 generates the mean of P_k (as decribed in the paper). The value of k and other parameters can be set within the code.
